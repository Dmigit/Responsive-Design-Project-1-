            <p>The concept for Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) was developed in 1937 and the first high school chapter was chartered in Tennessee in 1942. In 1958, the first collegiate chapter of Phi Beta Lambda (PBL) was chartered in Iowa.  The FBLA-Middle Level division was started in 1994 for students in grades 5-9. The Alumni & Professional Network, to be established in 2021, is rooted in the former Professional Division (originally the Alumni Division) which began in 1979.</p>
